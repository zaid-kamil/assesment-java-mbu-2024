        n = 5
        num1 = 5
        num2 = 10
    Output: 5, 10, 15, 25, 40
```

Q3. Create a class OptimusPrime that have following methods:

    `isPrime(int num)`
    
    `sumPrime(int startValue, int endValue)`

---

Q4. Write a calculator program in Java that takes 2 numbers as input and performs the following operations:

    1. Addition
    2. Subtraction
    3. Multiplication
    4. Division
    5. Modulus

---

Q5. Write a program in Java to find the factorial of a number using recursion.

---

Q6. Write a menu based program in Java for a restaurant. It should have 5 items in menu. The user can select as many items as he wants. The program should display the total amount to be paid. Also, if the user selects an item that is not in the menu, the program should print "Invalid choice" and ask the user to select again.

---

## INTERMEDIATE LEVEL

Q11. Write a program to find the sum of the following series:

    1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + ... + 1/n

_hint: Use for loop to iterate from 1 to n_

---

Q12. Write a program to check if a number is a perfect number or not.

```
Example:
    Input: 28
    Output: Perfect number

    Input: 15
    Output: Not a perfect number
```
_a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself like 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 or 6 = 1 + 2 + 3_

---

Q13. Write a java program to find the second largest number in an array.

```
example:
    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Output: 4

    Input: [10, 5, 20, 8, 15]
    Output: 15
```
_The program should handle arrays with duplicate elements.
If the array has less than two unique elements, the program should return a message indicating that the second largest element does not exist._

---

Q14. Write a Java program to check if 2 strings are anagrams of each other.

```
Example:
    Input: "listen", "silent"
    Output: Anagrams

    Input: "hello", "world"
    Output: Not anagrams
```
_An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once._

---

Q15. Write a Java program to find the first non-repeating character in a string.
    
```
Example:
    Input: "hello"
    Output: h

    Input: "teeter"
    Output: r
```
---

Q16. Write a Java program to reverse the words in a given sentence.
```
Example:
    Input: "Hello World"
    Output: "World Hello

    Input: "I am a Java Developer"

    Output: "Developer Java a am I"
```
---

Q17. Write a Java program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.

```
Example:
    Input: "hello"
    Output: Vowels: 2, Consonants: 3

    Input: "world"
    Output: Vowels: 1, Consonants: 4
```

---

Q18. Write a Java program to find the common elements between two arrays of integers.

```
Example:
    Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
    Output: [4, 5]

    Input: [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]
    Output: No common elements
```
